# Animation In Console

## Description
- This project creates a **dynamic 3D rotation animation** rendered directly in the Python console using ASCII characters.  
- It also contains a set of additional mini-tools: email validator, unique number counter, file saver, and weather API request.  
- The project is designed for **students who need a complete Python application** demonstrating file handling, APIs, animations, math, data structures, and menu navigation.

# Completed functionality and approximate grades from your perception

List of all points you want to be graded for:

### Implemented features
1. **Email validation** — (regex, input validation)  
2. **Number of unique numbers** — (data handling)  
3. **Save text to a file** — (external file usage)  
4. **Get weather info of random coordinates** — (API usage)  
5. **Animation in console** — (3D → 2D projection, rotation, line drawing)  

### Code & design
- **Menu system** — (user interaction)  
- Proper use of **dict, list, set, tuple** 
- **Exception handling** 
- **Functions documented with docstrings**  
- No code outside functions 
- <10 functions per file 
- <300 lines per file  
- Project has **README.md** 
- Project has **requirements.txt**
